# Content and Commerce Management Strategy

**Date:** 2025-05-12 (Update with current date)

## 1. Context and Problem

The RevampIT website requires a robust strategy for managing two main types of dynamic information:
1.  **Website Content:** Pages like "Workshops," "About Us," "Projects," which are currently mostly built on the frontend and need a more maintainable and scalable content management solution. Workshop information, in particular, needs to be easily updatable.
2.  **Webshop Inventory:** A separate existing webshop (currently on Kivitendo/Joomla) with thousands of used computers and parts needs to be integrated or rebuilt with a modern backend that simplifies inventory and product management.

## 2. Goals

*   Maximize ease of content creation and updates for non-technical users (for workshops, static pages).
*   Efficiently manage a large and frequently changing inventory for the webshop (used computers and parts).
*   Ensure the overall system is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices.
*   Leverage the existing Next.js frontend structure where possible.

## 3. Options Considered

1.  **Strapi Alone:** Robust headless CMS with good content modeling and internationalization, but not primarily designed for complex e-commerce inventory, order, and cart management.
2.  **MedusaJS Alone:** Strong for e-commerce and inventory; content management capabilities are present but less rich and customizable for general website content (like blogs, informational pages) compared to a dedicated CMS like Strapi.
3.  **Combined Strapi and MedusaJS:** Leverages the strengths of Strapi for comprehensive content management and internationalization, and MedusaJS for its powerful e-commerce engine. This provides a best-of-breed solution for both needs.

## 4. Chosen Strategy: Phased Approach with Strapi and MedusaJS

A phased approach is chosen to manage complexity, build on existing progress, and utilize the most appropriate tools for each primary need. The initial focus will be on establishing a robust, multilingual content website using Strapi. The e-commerce integration with MedusaJS will be a subsequent, distinct phase.

### Phase 1: Establish Multilingual Content Website with Strapi

*   **Action:** Integrate Strapi as the headless CMS for the Next.js application.
*   **Scope:** Manage content for workshops, static pages (e.g., "About Us," "Projects"), blog posts, and other informational content. Implement robust internationalization for all planned languages (German, English, French, Italian). The existing webshop will remain an external link.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Set up a new Strapi backend instance.
    *   Define content types (collections and single types) in Strapi, including fields necessary for all languages.
    *   Migrate existing content from JSON files (and any other sources) into Strapi.
    *   Update Next.js pages and components to fetch content from Strapi's API, handling localization based on the route.
    *   Adapt existing frontend components to consume data from Strapi.
    *   Ensure the current external link to the Kivitendo/Joomla webshop remains functional.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for non-technical users to manage content across multiple languages.
    *   Strapi's strong API capabilities and internationalization features are well-suited for the project's immediate needs.
    *   Establishes a scalable foundation for all website content, independent of the e-commerce component initially.

### Future Phase: E-commerce Development with MedusaJS (Phase 2 - Parallel Build)

*   **Action:** Develop and launch a new, modern webshop using MedusaJS, to run in parallel with the existing externally linked Kivitendo/Joomla system.
*   **Scope:** The new MedusaJS webshop will manage its own catalog (which may initially include a subset of items or new offerings), inventory, product details, variants, orders, and checkout. This phase will commence after the multilingual content website (Phase 1) is stable and complete.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Set up a new, separate MedusaJS backend instance for the new webshop.
    *   Define the product catalog strategy for the new MedusaJS shop. This may involve selecting specific products, potentially sourcing some data from Kivitendo/Joomla if items are to be duplicated or transitioned, but not a full, immediate migration and replacement.
    *   Build dedicated frontend sections/pages in the Next.js application for the new MedusaJS webshop (e.g., under a specific path like `/new-shop` or a subdomain). These pages will interact with the new MedusaJS API.
    *   The existing Kivitendo/Joomla webshop will continue to be accessible via its current external link.
    *   Plan for clear user communication regarding the two available webshops during the parallel run.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Allows for the development and testing of a new e-commerce solution (MedusaJS) without disrupting the existing Kivitendo/Joomla webshop.
    *   Provides an opportunity to gather user feedback on the new shop before making decisions about the old system.
    *   Reduces risk by not attempting a direct cutover migration for a complex e-commerce system initially.

### Future Phase: Webshop Consolidation & Advanced Integration (Phase 3)

*   **Consideration:** After the new MedusaJS webshop (from Phase 2) is operational and evaluated, a strategic decision will be made regarding the Kivitendo/Joomla webshop. This could involve decommissioning it, migrating all its data to MedusaJS, or other solutions.
*   **Potential Implementation (Post-Decision):**
    *   If consolidating on MedusaJS: Perform a full data migration from Kivitendo/Joomla to MedusaJS.
    *   Update website navigation to direct all e-commerce traffic to the MedusaJS shop.
    *   Establish deeper integrations between content in Strapi and the unified MedusaJS e-commerce platform (e.g., richer product storytelling, related content).
*   **Rationale:** Aims to eventually provide a single, cohesive, and modern e-commerce experience, while allowing for a data-driven decision-making process regarding the existing system.

## 5. Justification for Phased Approach

*   **Risk Mitigation:** Addresses distinct complex problems (content management with internationalization vs. e-commerce inventory and logistics) in focused stages.
*   **Best-of-Breed:** Allows for using Strapi for its rich content management, customization, and internationalization features, and MedusaJS for its robust e-commerce engine.
*   **Scalability and Maintainability:** Both Strapi and MedusaJS are designed for scalability and offer good developer experiences, leading to a more maintainable long-term solution.
*   **Incremental Value:** Delivers improvements to content management and internationalization quickly (Phase 1). Allows for the careful introduction of a new e-commerce platform (Phase 2) in parallel, before a final decision on consolidating webshop operations (Phase 3).

## 6. High-Level Next Steps

**Current Focus (Phase 1):**
1.  **Strapi Integration & Content Migration:**
    *   Install and configure Strapi.
    *   Define content types/schemas in Strapi, including localization settings for German, English, French, and Italian.
    *   Begin migrating existing content from JSON files to Strapi.
    *   Update Next.js frontend to fetch content from Strapi and handle multilingual routing.
    *   Ensure the external webshop link (to Kivitendo/Joomla) continues to function.

**Future Phases (After Phase 1 Completion):**
2.  **New E-commerce Platform Development (MedusaJS - Parallel Build):**
    *   Detailed planning for the new MedusaJS webshop setup.
    *   Define product catalog and data strategy for the new MedusaJS shop.
    *   Build and integrate the new MedusaJS-powered shop with the Next.js frontend, running in parallel to the existing external webshop.
3.  **Webshop Consolidation & Decision Making (Post-Parallel Run):**
    *   Evaluate the performance of the new MedusaJS shop.
    *   Plan and execute the decided strategy for the Kivitendo/Joomla webshop (e.g., migration, decommissioning).
    *   Implement advanced Strapi-MedusaJS integrations.
